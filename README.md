Above is a picture of the main game interface. The user's goal is to reach the screen's bottom left corner. To go through a door and unlock that door, they have to answer a Marvel trivia question correctly; otherwise, the door will be forever locked. If the user cannot reach the end, the game will end, and the game will show the user's score and put it on the leaderboard.
